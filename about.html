		<p class="description"> No one should feel unsafe, and we're here to change that. 
		<br> At Journiere, we strive to a women's safety app unlike any other. 
		<br> We use location services from real time traffic and crime scene data to calculate density
		<br> in a given area to provide users with a map of the safest walking routes.
		<br> In addition, Journiere incorporates tactics used at <a href="http://nytlive.nytimes.com/womenintheworld/2016/10/24/new-codeword-allows-women-at-risk-to-discreetly-request-help-from-bartenders/"> bars</a> to provide "safe voice
		<br> commands" that serves as an emergency alert system for when users are feeling unsafe.
